## Vercel Speed Insights Integration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Kolamba Next.js 14.1.0 project.

### Changes Made

#### Installed
- `@vercel/speed-insights` package (version ^1.3.1) - Added to project dependencies

#### Modified Files
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout component
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the body tag, after the Providers wrapper
  - Placement follows Next.js 13.5+ App Router best practices

- `frontend/package.json` - Updated with new dependency
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with dependency lock information

### Implementation Details

Since this project uses Next.js 14.1.0 (which is >= 13.5) with the App Router:
- Used the recommended import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Placed the component in the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Positioned the component inside the `<body>` tag after all content, following Next.js conventions
- No additional configuration needed - the component will automatically collect Web Vitals data

### Build Verification

- Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
- All 16 routes compiled without errors
- No TypeScript errors introduced
- Build output shows successful static page generation

### Why This Approach

For Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router:
1. The `@vercel/speed-insights/next` import automatically enables Next.js optimizations
2. No manual route tracking needed (unlike Pages Router or older versions)
3. Placement after children ensures it doesn't block page rendering
4. Minimal performance overhead as it's a lightweight monitoring script

### Next Steps

The Speed Insights component will:
- Automatically collect Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS, etc.)
- Send anonymized performance data to Vercel
- Data will be visible in Vercel dashboard once deployed
